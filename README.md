# How to contribute

## Find an issue to work on

First, look for an open issue, if there are none available, think of something you would like to work on and propose it in a clear and organized way.

## Get the issue in charge

If the issue has no one assigned to it and you wish to work on it, ask first if you can work on it and then start working.

## Pull Request

Once you think you're good to go, submit a Pull Request assigned the issue you are working on. Wait for the reviews to be done, if everything is okay then it will be merged into main, otherwise fix what need to be fixed and just commit the changes on the branch you did the pull request.
