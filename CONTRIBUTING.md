### 3. Get the issue in charge
If the issue has no one assigned to it and you wish to work on it, ask first if you can work on it and then start working.

### 4. Create a branch
Create a branch in your forked repository to work on your issue

### 5. Commit your work

### 6. Pull Request
Once you think you're good to go, submit a Pull Request assigned the issue you are working on. Wait for the reviews to be done, if everything is okay then it will be merged into main, otherwise fix what need to be fixed and just commit the changes on the branch you did the pull request.

### 7. Submitting
Add relevant information about your solution, if needed also some screenshots would be great.
